Important safety tips: Store medications securely, never share medications between pets, check expiration dates regularly, and report side effects immediately.

For choking: Open mouth, look for visible objects. For small dogs/cats hold upside down and strike between shoulder blades. For large dogs lift hind legs and strike between shoulder blades. Never blindly reach into mouth.

For bleeding: Apply direct pressure with clean cloth, don't remove blood-soaked bandages (add more layers), elevate wound if possible, and seek immediate veterinary care.

For heatstroke: Move to cool area immediately, apply cool water to paw pads and belly, offer small amounts of water if conscious, and transport to vet immediately.

Consistency is everything - use the same commands every time, ensure all family members follow the same rules, and practice daily even if just for 5 minutes.

Positive reinforcement works best: reward good behavior immediately, use high-value treats for training, and praise enthusiastically.

What worked for us: crate training reduced separation anxiety, "leave it" command prevented destructive chewing, and regular exercise before training sessions helped focus.

Some behaviors took weeks to change, but the progress was worth it. Every dog is different - find what motivates yours and stick with it!''',
